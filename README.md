# Ai-4-Linus
Just a collection of links and literature to AI themes for my nephew. Ever growing - ever reorganised 

At this point I will just copy links here in this readme.

a glossar is given as simple text file.

First word about a CNN Hardware (sorry this is in german ;-) )

Eventually, these neural networks are just tensors of 3. level containing processing-coeffiecents. 
Further there is another tensor-cube, that has per node a reference to a function describing the manipulation of the current node coefficient in dependence to the  input values of the node. The function cube has layers of different function classes - add: Adding, filtering etc. Thatâ€™s it. ðŸ˜‰
